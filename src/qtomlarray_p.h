  * @file qtomlarray_p.h
  * @brief Private implementation details for QTomlArray class using PIMPL pattern.
  *
  * This header contains the private implementation class for QTomlArray,
  * following Qt's PIMPL (Private Implementation) pattern for binary compatibility
  * and compilation hiding. The private class encapsulates the actual container
  * storage while keeping the public interface clean and stable.
  *
  * Design principles:
  * - Minimal overhead with maximum performance
  * - Direct use of Qt containers for optimal integration
  * - Snake_case naming for internal member variables per project standards
  * - Qt naming conventions for class names (ClassNamePrivate)
  * - Exception-safe design through Qt container guarantees
  *
  * The implementation focuses on:
  * - Efficient element storage and access
  * - STL-compatible iterator support
  * - Memory management through Qt's proven container architecture
  * - High-performance operations for both small and large arrays
  *
  * @note This file is part of the private API and should not be included directly
  * @note Implementation details may change between versions without notice
  * @note Only QTomlArray and internal systems should access this interface
  * @see qtomlarray.h for the public interface

   * @class QTomlArrayPrivate
   * @brief Private implementation class for QTomlArray using PIMPL pattern.
   *
   * This class contains the actual data storage for QTomlArray objects,
   * using QVector<QTomlValue> as the underlying container for optimal
   * performance and Qt integration. The design emphasizes simplicity
   * and efficiency through direct container delegation.
   *
   * The class is designed for:
   * - **Performance**: Direct QVector usage for optimal memory layout and access patterns
   * - **Compatibility**: Full STL iterator support through QVector's interface
   * - **Integration**: Seamless interoperability with Qt's container ecosystem
   * - **Simplicity**: Minimal wrapper overhead with direct delegation to QVector
   * - **Memory Efficiency**: Leverages QVector's optimized memory management
   *
   * Container characteristics:
   * QVector provides excellent characteristics for TOML array storage:
   * - Contiguous memory layout for cache-friendly access
   * - Amortized O(1) append operations
   * - O(1) random access by index
   * - Efficient memory reallocation strategies
   * - Built-in capacity management and growth policies
   *
   * Performance profile:
   * - Random access: O(1) constant time
   * - Append operations: O(1) amortized, O(n) worst case during reallocation
   * - Insert/remove in middle: O(n) due to element shifting
   * - Memory usage: Minimal overhead beyond stored elements
   * - Iterator operations: STL-compatible with full performance
   *
   * Thread safety:
   * - Read operations are thread-safe when no modifications occur
   * - Write operations require external synchronization
   * - QVector provides standard Qt container thread safety guarantees
   * - Copy construction is thread-safe with proper synchronization
   *
   * @note This class follows Qt's private implementation naming convention
   * @note Member variables use snake_case naming for internal consistency
   * @note Direct manipulation should be avoided; use QTomlArray public interface
   * @note Designed for minimal overhead and maximum performance
   *
   * @see QTomlArray for the public interface

	 *
	 * Construction characteristics:
	 * - No memory allocation occurs during construction
	 * - Container is ready for immediate use

	 * QTomlArrayPrivate impl;              // Empty state
	 * Q_ASSERT(impl.values_.isEmpty());    // No elements
	 * Q_ASSERT(impl.values_.capacity() == 0); // No allocated memory

	 * @brief Copy constructor using compiler-generated implementation.
	 *
	 * Creates a deep copy of another QTomlArrayPrivate instance by copying
	 * the underlying QVector container. The compiler-generated version is
	 * sufficient as QVector has proper copy semantics with efficient
	 * copy-on-write optimization where applicable.
	 *
	 * Copy characteristics:
	 * - All elements are deep-copied through QTomlValue copy constructors
	 * - Container capacity may be optimized in the copy
	 * - Copy-on-write optimization may defer actual copying until modification
	 * - Result is completely independent of the source object
	 *
	 * Performance:
	 * - Time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements
	 * - QVector's copy constructor is highly optimized
	 * - Memory allocation occurs for the new container's storage
	 * - QTomlValue copying may benefit from internal optimizations
	 *
	 * @param other The QTomlArrayPrivate instance to copy from
	 *
	 * @complexity O(n) where n is the number of elements in values_
	 * @exception Strong exception safety through QVector copy constructor
	 *
	 * @note Compiler-generated version is explicitly declared for clarity
	 * @note QVector handles all memory management and element copying
	 * @note Creates completely independent copy suitable for separate modification
	 *
	 * @example Copy independence:
	 * @code
	 * QTomlArrayPrivate original;
	 * original.values_.append(QTomlValue("test"));
	 *
	 * QTomlArrayPrivate copy(original);    // Deep copy
	 * Q_ASSERT(copy.values_.size() == original.values_.size());
	 *
	 * // Modifications are independent
	 * copy.values_.append(QTomlValue("new"));
	 * Q_ASSERT(original.values_.size() == 1);  // Original unchanged
	 * Q_ASSERT(copy.values_.size() == 2);      // Copy modified

	/**
	 * @brief The underlying container storing all array elements.
	 *
	 * This QVector<QTomlValue> serves as the primary storage for all elements
	 * in the TOML array. QVector is chosen for its excellent performance
	 * characteristics and seamless integration with Qt's ecosystem.
	 *
	 * Container benefits:
	 * - **Memory Layout**: Contiguous storage for optimal cache performance
	 * - **Access Performance**: O(1) random access to elements by index
	 * - **Growth Strategy**: Intelligent capacity management with geometric growth
	 * - **STL Compatibility**: Full iterator support for algorithms and range-based loops
	 * - **Qt Integration**: Native compatibility with Qt's container interfaces
	 *
	 * Storage characteristics:
	 * - Elements are stored in insertion order (TOML arrays are ordered)
	 * - Supports heterogeneous element types through QTomlValue
	 * - Automatic memory management with RAII principles
	 * - Efficient reallocation strategies for growing arrays
	 * - Capacity can exceed size for amortized append performance
	 *
	 * Operation complexity:
	 * - Element access by index: O(1)
	 * - Append to end: O(1) amortized
	 * - Prepend to beginning: O(n) due to element shifting
	 * - Insert in middle: O(n) due to element shifting
	 * - Remove from end: O(1)
	 * - Remove from middle: O(n) due to element shifting
	 *
	 * Memory management:
	 * - Automatic allocation and deallocation
	 * - Geometric growth strategy (typically 2x capacity increase)
	 * - Memory released when container is destroyed
	 * - Capacity can be managed through reserve() and squeeze() operations
	 *
	 * Thread safety:
	 * - Read operations are thread-safe when no modifications occur
	 * - Concurrent modifications require external synchronization
	 * - Iterator invalidation follows standard Qt container rules
	 * - Safe for concurrent read access from multiple threads
	 *
	 * @note Snake_case naming follows internal implementation convention
	 * @note All QTomlArray operations delegate to this container
	 * @note Supports full TOML specification array semantics
	 * @note Memory layout is optimized for sequential access patterns
	 *
	 * @example Element management:
	 * @code
	 * QTomlArrayPrivate impl;
	 *
	 * // Adding elements
	 * impl.values_.append(QTomlValue(42));
	 * impl.values_.append(QTomlValue("hello"));
	 * impl.values_.append(QTomlValue(true));
	 *
	 * // Accessing elements
	 * Q_ASSERT(impl.values_[0].toInteger() == 42);
	 * Q_ASSERT(impl.values_[1].toString() == "hello");
	 * Q_ASSERT(impl.values_[2].toBool() == true);
	 *
	 * // Container properties
	 * Q_ASSERT(impl.values_.size() == 3);
	 * Q_ASSERT(!impl.values_.isEmpty());
	 *
	 * // Iterator support
	 * for (const auto& value : impl.values_) {
	 *     // Process each QTomlValue
	 * }
